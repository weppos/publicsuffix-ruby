## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've discovered a vulnerability in YARD source code, please email
lsegal@soen.ca with as much information as possible. You should typically
receive a response within 24-48 hours, though depending on scheduling
it may take up to a week to respond. If you do not get a response on
your initial email within a few days, please re-send your email or
reach out on other channels (such as yardoc@googlegroups.com) to
try to get a hold of a maintainer. Please do not include sensitive
material if you are reaching out through secondary channels unless
you first receive confirmation that it is okay.

Thank you for your help and cooperation in making YARD a stable and
safe piece of software.
